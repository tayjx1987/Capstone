With the higher penetration of internet worldwide comes the rise of ecommerce. More businesses, online or brick and mortar , are using customer's reviews to stand out from the competition. More consumers are also relying on online reviews for purchase decision making.

With online reviews getting more popular, reviews are becoming a tool whereby business seeks to improve sales. Business can also be targeted with fake review to tarish the reputation.

This project aims to train a machine learning classifier model to predict whether a review posted on Yelp is recommended/spam/genuine or not recommended/ham/fake. This should give insights on some features of a spam/fake/not recommended review.
